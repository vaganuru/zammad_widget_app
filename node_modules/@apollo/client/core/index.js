// Note that importing `gql` by itself, then destructuring
// additional properties separately before exporting, is intentional.
// Due to the way the `graphql-tag` library is setup, certain bundlers
// can't find the properties added to the exported `gql` function without
// additional guidance (e.g. Rollup - see
// https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#error-name-is-not-exported-by-module).
// Instead of having people that are using bundlers with `@apollo/client` add
// extra bundler config to help `graphql-tag` exports be found (which would be
// awkward since they aren't importing `graphql-tag` themselves), this
// workaround of pulling the extra properties off the `gql` function,
// then re-exporting them separately, helps keeps bundlers happy without any
// additional config changes.
